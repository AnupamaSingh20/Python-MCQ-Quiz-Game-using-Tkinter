# Python-MCQ-Quiz-Game-using-Tkinter

Developed a simple multiple-choice quiz game in python with GUI for my students. Used Python's GUI framework - Tkinter to develop fast and easy GUI
quiz applications. The data for the quiz is defined in a JSON file with JSON data which are name/value pairs and contain an array of values. Added widgets to display data and added buttons to move to the next question and quit the quiz.
